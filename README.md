# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Resources
The following link to the various components of the project, which can be found in both [`UFO-level-1`](https://github.com/SaltireSequence/javascript-challenge/blob/master/UFO-level-1) & [`UFO-level-2`](https://github.com/SaltireSequence/javascript-challenge/blob/master/UFO-level-2) dirs
* [`Static Folder`](https://github.com/SaltireSequence/javascript-challenge/blob/master/UFO-level-1/static) - contains static resources, such as images.
* [`index.html`](https://github.com/SaltireSequence/javascript-challenge/blob/master/UFO-level-1/index.html) - creating a basic HTML website, to show my results.
* [`style.css`](https://github.com/SaltireSequence/javascript-challenge/blob/master/UFO-level-1/style.css) - a CSS stylesheet, for my HTML website.
* [`data.js`](https://github.com/SaltireSequence/javascript-challenge/blob/master/UFO-level-1/data.js) - contains the data (in JSON) for rendering in the table.
* [`app.js`](https://github.com/SaltireSequence/javascript-challenge/blob/master/UFO-level-1/app.js) - the main JavaScript code to run.

## Background

Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3.js, I wanted to write JavaScript code that dynamically creates a table, based on the dataset provided to it (see: [`data.js`](https://github.com/SaltireSequence/javascript-challenge/blob/master/UFO-level-1/data.js))

### Preparation

1. Created a new repository for this project called `javascript-challenge`.


3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Javascript challenge. Use the folder names to correspond to the challenges: **UFO-level-1** and **UFO-level-2**.

4. Add your **html** files to this folder as well as your static folder containing your javascript. This will be the main script to run for analysis.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Create a basic HTML web page or use the [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Make sure you have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
